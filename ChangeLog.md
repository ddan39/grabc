# v1.0.2
 * Was not working properly on Ubuntu Terminal. It was using default Colormap. Do not use default colormap, rather get it from window attributes. 
 * If could not get XImage from target window, it is probably root window,
    so try to grab it from there.
* Added some options
* Color can be grabbed from a specific location

* Change Copyright to MIT from GNU GPL
